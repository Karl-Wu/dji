# DJI

CLI and Ruby tools for drone-maker DJI's store, account, order status and more.


## Installation

If you already have Ruby installed on your computer, you can install this. Otherwise, go install Ruby and come back to these instructions.

Open a command line (Terminal on macOS):

    $ gem install dji

When updates are released, you can get them with:

    $ gem update dji

If you do not manage your Ruby installations with RVM and are just using the system ruby, you might need to prefix the above commands with sudo, such as:

    $ sudo gem install dji

If you are on Ubuntu Linux, you can do:

    $ sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev
    $ sudo gem install dji

## Usage

### Order Tracking

```
$ dji track [options]

REQUIRED:

  -o, --order ORDER_NUMBER    # Your order number
  -p, --phone PHONE_TAIL      # Last 4 digits of your phone number

OPTIONAL:
  
  -r, --repeat INTERVAL       # Repeat every INTERVAL seconds
  --publish                   # Publish your order details to http://dji-track.herokuapp.com/orders
  -c, --country COUNTRY       # Your country (use 3 letter code, such as USA)
  -t, --order_time TIMESTAMP  # The timestamp from your private order page at https://accounts.dji.com/user/orders surrounded by quotes (i.e. "2016-09-29 11:21:21 (UTC)")
  -u, --dji_username USERNAME # Your DJI Forum username
  -d, --debug                 # Some additional output used when emailing kevin@welikeinc.com for assistance
```

#### Example: Track an order

Use your order number in place of ORDER_NUMBER and the last 4 digits of your phone number for PHONE_TAIL. A full example might look like this:

    $ dji track -o 123456789012 -p 1234

    ORDER TRACKING AS OF 2016-10-27 01:12:27 -0700
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Order Number     : 123456789012
    Total            : USD $1,398.00
    Payment Status   : Pay Confirmed
    Shipping Status  : Pending
    Shipping Company : Tba
    Tracking Number  : 

#### Example: Track an order, every 60 seconds

If you want this to repeat automatically at an interval, specify the option for repeat (either -r or --repeat) with the number of seconds. Do not use this nefariously, I suggest a reasonable interval such as 60 seconds, but more useful is probably around 300 seconds (5 minutes) to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

    $ dji track -o 123456789012 -p 1234 -r 60

### Search FedEx and track by reference

If you think your shipper is FedEx but you don't have a tracking code yet, you might be able to find your shipment by
searching Fedex by reference. This allows you to search and track by reference.

    $ dji track -c COUNTRY_CODE -p POSTAL_CODE

An example of searching in the USA (country code is us) with a postal code:

    $ dji fedex -c us -p 94123
